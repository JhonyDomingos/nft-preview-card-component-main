# My process
  First I started build the HTML giving the tags Classes the alts, putting everything in order, after, I start build the sytle. 
  I reset the CSS, basic configurations like (Importing the Font-family, font-size, backgrounds), The next thing I did was configure the container and the main image configuration, next step was building configure the UL/LI positioning the img and texts, next step it was positioning the avatar and the name of the creator, giving sim the right color, widths, display, margins and etc..
  the next step was hover effects, in the Equilibrium title and creator's name.
  next step was the hard one, the ICON VIEW, this was such a big problem to me, first challange was the position in the middle, after that 
  was the hover effects made the img appering just when you pass the cursor on it. but after a fews videos, reading documentation and a lot 
  of headache I got this using the opacity 0 and 1 in the hover.


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned
   I learn how to use hover in diffrent circustancies, improve my flexbox knowledge, position was very important for me to pratice, configure laytour container, learn how to use better the cascade and inheritance, using medias ( I'm still learning this) to responsive layouts. and Do not Freakout when everyhting you try goes wrong and the layout breaks LOL

  <p>I'm very proud of myself by get the result that I search, of course I need too many things to learn but, this is a big step for me</p>
</article>
```
```css
.proud-of-myself {
  font-family:'Times New Roman', sans-serif;
  color: hsl(212Â°, 54%, 43%);
  text-align: center;
}


### Continued development
I would like to keeping focus on HTML and #CSS, Surely I will learn Javascrip now !!! 


### Useful resources

- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp) - This helped in CSS FlexBox and media query. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [StackOverflow](hhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/10765755/how-to-apply-multiple-transforms-in-css) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand the trasnform. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
